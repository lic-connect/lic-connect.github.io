00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Hello and welcome.

00:02.000 --> 00:08.000
Let's understand the basic terminologies used in the life insurance industry.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
part 1

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
1. Minimum Age at Entry

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Minimum age at entry refers to the lowest age at which a person can buy a particular LIC policy.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
In simpler terms, it tells us the youngest age at which someone can become a policy holder.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
Each LIC plan has a specific minimum age requirement depending on the policy type and risk involved.

00:35.000 --> 00:47.000
For example, a child plan may allow entry as early as 0 years, but while a pension plan might require the person to be at least 18 years old.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Real-world example, suppose Raj and Priya have just had a baby named Arab.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
They want to secure his future by investing in a child plan.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
LIC's new children's money back plan allows entry for children as young as 0 years.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
So, they can immediately purchase a policy in Arab's name.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
Now consider a young man named Rohan, who just turned 17 and wants to start saving early.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
He wants to invest in an endowment plan.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
However, the minimum age for that plan is 18.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
In this case, he will need to wait until his 18th birthday to become eligible.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
The rationale behind setting a minimum age is to ensure that the policy holder is of a certain age where insurability is meaningful,

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
and in some cases, where consent and legal standing, like majority age, is important.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
2. Maximum age at entry

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
Maximum age at entry is the highest age at which a person can apply for a particular life insurance plan.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
It is determined based on the risk appetite of the insurance company and the duration of the policy.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
LIC defines this limit to ensure that the person has a reasonable chance of surviving the policy term,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
thereby balancing risk and benefit.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
Real-world example, let's take the example of Mr. Sharma, who is 60 years old and is looking to buy an endowment policy.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
If the LIC plan he wants to buy has a maximum age at entry of 55, he won't be eligible.

02:37.000 --> 02:50.000
However, LIC offers certain pension plans or term insurance plans where the maximum entry age can go up to 65 or even 75 in some cases.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
This restriction protects both the policy holder and the insurer.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
Older individuals typically pose a higher health risk, so insurers limit entry to ensure the policy remains viable.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
3. Minimum sum assured

03:07.000 --> 03:17.000
Minimum sum assured is the least amount of money that LIC will pay to the nominee or policy holder in the event of death or policy maturity.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
This is the base coverage amount promised in the insurance contract.

03:22.000 --> 03:32.000
Each plan defines this minimum limit to make sure the cover is meaningful and justifies the administrative and underwriting costs.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
Real-world example, imagine Neha wants to buy a term insurance plan from LIC.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
The plan she is interested in has a minimum sum assured off to lakhs rupees.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
This means she cannot purchase that plan for a lower coverage amount like one lakh rupees.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
She must opt for at least to lakhs rupees.

03:55.000 --> 04:07.000
The purpose of setting a minimum sum assured is to ensure the benefit amount is sufficient for the needs it is intended to cover, such as education, marriage or death clearance.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
4. Maximum sum assured

04:10.000 --> 04:19.000
Maximum sum assured is the highest life cover or insurance benefit one can take under a particular policy.

04:19.000 --> 04:29.000
Some LIC plans do not have a maximum limit and allow the sum assured based on underwriting and financial capacity of the insured.

04:29.000 --> 04:41.000
Real-world example, say a businessman named Mr. Agraval wants to buy a term insurance policy to cover his business liabilities worth one crore rupees.

04:41.000 --> 04:51.000
LIC's tech term plan allows him to choose any sum assured starting from 50 lakhs rupees with no upper cap subject to income proof.

04:51.000 --> 05:01.000
Hence, if Mr. Agraval can justify his income and financial needs, he can get a cover of one crore rupees or more.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
High sum assured policies are beneficial for individuals with high financial responsibilities.

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
However, they undergo strict underwriting including medical checks and financial documentation.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
5. Minimum policy term

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
The policy term is the duration for which the policy will remain in force.

05:24.000 --> 05:33.000
The minimum policy term is the shortest period for which one can buy a particular LIC policy. It varies from plan to plan.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Real-world example, suppose Priya wants a short term savings plan.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
She chooses a money back policy from LIC which has a minimum term of 20 years.

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
If she is looking for something shorter, she might consider LIC's term plan with a 10 year term.

05:54.000 --> 06:05.000
Short policy terms are useful when the policy holder has specific short term goals such as a child's marriage in 10 years or retirement in a few years.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
6. Maximum policy term

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
Maximum policy term is the longest duration for which a particular policy can remain active.

06:15.000 --> 06:23.000
This limit ensures that the policy doesn't extend beyond a practical age for maturity or risk coverage.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
Real-world example, let's consider a 25 year old named Suresh who wants long term life coverage.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
He selects LIC's Given Lab plan which allows a maximum policy term of 25 years.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
So, if he opts for the full term, his policy will mature when he turns 50.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
Some policies, like term plans, offer terms up to 40 years depending on the entry age.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
The longer the term, the higher the risk for LIC, which is why they have limits.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
It also aligns with human life expectancy and practical planning needs.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
7. Minimum age at maturity

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
Minimum age at maturity is the lowest age at which the policy holder can receive maturity benefits.

07:16.000 --> 07:25.000
This ensures that the maturity payout happens only when the insured reaches a certain responsible or legally adult age.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
Real-world example, let's say are of parents bought a child plan when he was a newborn.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
The minimum maturity age under the plan is 18 years.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
So, even though they bought it at age 0, the earliest the benefits will be paid is when are of turns 18.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
This is typically aligned with age of adulthood or when financial responsibilities begin.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
This condition ensures that the insured has the legal capacity to handle the funds.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
8. Maximum age at maturity

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
Maximum age at maturity is the oldest age at which a policy holder can receive the benefits under a policy.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
LIC sets this age to ensure practical viability, usually aligning with life expectancy.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
Real-world example, suppose Mr Kapoor, aged 50, wants to invest in a 30-year term plan.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
This means the policy will mature when he turns 80.

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
If the plan has a maximum maturity age of 75, he won't be eligible for a 30-year term.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
Instead, he might need to opt for a shorter term like 25 years.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
This rule ensures that policies don't stretch beyond realistic human life spends.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
9. Premium Paying Term PPT

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
Premium paying term PPT refers to the number of years the policy holder has to pay premiums.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
It can be equal to over less than the policy term.

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
Real-world example, SEMA buys a 20-year LIC policy but opts for a limited premium paying term of 10 years.

09:16.000 --> 09:25.000
This means she only needs to pay premiums for the first 10 years while the policy coverage continues for 20 years.

09:25.000 --> 09:34.000
This feature is useful for people who expect their income to reduce later in life or want to finish paying early.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
10. ADDB RIDER

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Accidental death and disability benefit rider

09:40.000 --> 09:50.000
ADDB rider provides an additional sum assured in case the life in short dies or becomes permanently disabled due to an accident.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
It's an optional rider that can be attached to many base LIC plans.

09:55.000 --> 10:07.000
Real-world example, imagine Rohit buys a policy with a base sum assured of 10 lakhs rupees and adds an ADDB rider for another 10 lakhs rupees.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
If he dies in an accident, his family will receive 20 lakhs rupees base plus ADDB.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
If he becomes permanently disabled, he may get the ADDB benefit in installments.

10:21.000 --> 10:33.000
This rider offers enhanced protection in unforeseen and unfortunate events especially useful for individuals in high-risk professions or frequent travelers.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
11. Accident Rider

10:36.000 --> 10:45.000
The accident rider provides an additional payout if the policy holder suffers death or sometimes specific injuries due to an accident.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
While similar to ADDB, this may be more limited in some policies.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Real-world example

10:54.000 --> 11:07.000
If Mina has a life insurance policy with an accident rider and she dies in a road accident, her nominee will receive the base sum assured plus the accident rider benefit.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
This financial support can help the family cope with sudden losses.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
12. TURN INSURANCE RIDER

11:15.000 --> 11:24.000
Term rider is an add-on that allows the policy holder to enhance the sum assured for a limited term within the base policy.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
It is usually cheaper than buying a separate term policy.

11:28.000 --> 11:38.000
Real-world example, Amit has a policy of 10 lakhs rupees but adds a term rider of 15 lakhs rupees for 20 years.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
If he passes away within 20 years, his nominee gets 25 lakhs rupees.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
After 20 years, the rider ends and only base cover remains.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
13. Premium waiver benefit, PWB

11:54.000 --> 12:06.000
PWB ensures that if the premium pair, usually parent or proposer, dies or becomes disabled, all future premiums are waived and the policy continues as normal.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
Real-world example, Raj buys a child plan for his son with PWB.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Unfortunately, Raj dies in an accident.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
Because of PWB, all future premiums are waived but the policy continues and his son will receive all maturity benefits.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
14. Critical Illness rider

12:30.000 --> 12:41.000
This rider offers a lump sum payout if the insured is diagnosed with a listed critical illness such as cancer, heart attack or kidney failure.

12:41.000 --> 12:51.000
Real-world example, if Shreya has a critical illness rider and is diagnosed with cancer, she will receive the rider some assured.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
This helps cover expensive treatments or compensate for income loss.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
15. Maturity

12:59.000 --> 13:08.000
Maturity refers to the date when the policy term ends and the insured receives the maturity amount including bonuses if applicable.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
Real-world example, Ravi took a 20 year endowment policy.

13:13.000 --> 13:22.000
After paying premiums for 20 years, the policy matures and he receives 5 lakhs rupees as maturity benefit.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
This helps fulfill his retirement or child education goals.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
16. Death Benefit

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
The death benefit is the amount paid to the nominee if the insured person dies during the policy term.

13:37.000 --> 13:46.000
This may include the sum assured, accrued bonuses and any additional rider benefits depending on the plan.

13:46.000 --> 13:55.000
Real-world example, Manoj had a sum assured of 10 lakhs rupees and had accumulated bonuses of 3 lakhs rupees.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
Upon his death, his wife, the nominee received 13 lakhs rupees as the death benefit.

14:02.000 --> 14:09.000
This financial support helped her manage household expenses and children's education.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
17. Nominee

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
A nominee is the person chosen by the policy holder to receive the benefits in case of the police holder's demise.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
A nominee can be a family member, child, spouse or even a trust.

14:25.000 --> 14:33.000
Real-world example, Rita took a life insurance policy and nominated her son Rohan as the nominee.

14:33.000 --> 14:43.000
In case of her unfortunate demise, LIC will pay the policy benefits directly to Rohan without any legal complications.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
18. Assigning

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
An assignee is a person or institution to whom the rights of the policy are legally transferred.

14:52.000 --> 15:00.000
This usually happens when the policy is used as collateral for a loan or as part of a legal settlement.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
Real-world example, Ramesh needed a loan and pledged his LIC policy to the bank.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
He assigned the policy to the bank.

15:10.000 --> 15:18.000
If Ramesh fails to repay the loan, the bank can claim the policy proceeds up to the outstanding loan amount.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
19. Premium

15:20.000 --> 15:32.000
Premium is the amount paid by the policy holder to the insurance company at regular intervals monthly, quarterly, half yearly or yearly to keep the policy active.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
Real-world example, Neha pays 12,000 rupees per year towards her LIC endowment plan.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
This amount is her annual premium.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
If she doesn't pay this, the policy may lapse.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
20. Grace Period

15:49.000 --> 15:59.000
Grace Period is the extra time given after the premium due date during which the policy holder can still pay the premium without losing policy benefits.

16:00.000 --> 16:09.000
For most LIC policies, it's 30 days for yearly, half yearly, quarterly modes and 15 days for monthly mode.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
Real-world example, amidst premium due date was 10th March, but he forgot.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
He paid it on 5th April.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
Since he paid within the 30-day Grace Period, his policy remained active without penalty.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
21. Look in Period

16:28.000 --> 16:36.000
The look in or free look period is typically 15 days, 30 days for online policies.

16:36.000 --> 16:45.000
From the date of receiving the policy document, during which the policy holder can cancel the policy if not satisfied.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
Real-world example, Priya bought a policy online but changed her mind after reading the terms.

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
She cancelled it within 30 days and received her premium back, minus minimal charges.

16:59.000 --> 17:12.000
22. LIC policies offer a loan facility after a certain period, usually 2-3 years, using the policy's surrender value as collateral.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
Real-world example, Ravi needed funds for his daughter's wedding.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
He took her to lack rupees loan against his endowment policy from LIC.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
The interest was lower than a personal loan and the policy continued.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
23. Lapse of Policy

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
A policy lapses if the premium is not paid even within the Grace Period.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.000
Once lapsed, the policy holder loses the insurance coverage and benefits unless revived.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
Real-world example, Rohit forgot to pay premiums for 2 years and missed the Grace Periods.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
His policy lapsed. He had to revive it later with penalty and interest.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
24. Mode of payment

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
It refers to how often premiums are paid.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
LIC allows modes like monthly, quarterly, half yearly and yearly.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
Real-world example, Sunita chose monthly payment mode through ECS.

18:16.000 --> 18:25.000
1000 rupees gets auto-dabitted every month, making it easier for her to manage compared to Lumps and yearly payments.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
25. Survival Benefit

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
Survival Benefit is a periodic payment made to the policy holder during the policy term provided they are alive.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Common in money back plans

18:39.000 --> 18:50.000
Real-world example, in LIC's money back plan, Anuj received 20% of the sum assured at the end of the 5th, 10th and 15th year.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
At maturity, he got the rest along with bonuses.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
26. Loyalty Addition

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
What is it? Loyalty Addition

19:02.000 --> 19:11.000
La is a type of non-guaranteed bonus declared by LIC for certain plans that have completed a minimum number of years.

19:11.000 --> 19:21.000
It is paid only once at the time of maturity or death and is a reward for staying invested in the policy for a longer duration.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Real-world example

19:24.000 --> 19:38.000
Suppose Rohan has a 20 year endowment policy with LIC and LIC declares a loyalty addition of 40 rupee per 1000 rupees some assured for policies that complete 20 years.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
If Rohan's sum assured is 5 lakhs rupees, his law will be.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
40 rupees times 5 lakhs rupees 1000 is equal to 20 thousand rupees.

19:50.000 --> 20:00.000
So, when his policy matchers, he will get 20 thousand rupees as a loyalty reward in addition to the sum assured and other bonuses.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
27. Guaranteed Addition

20:04.000 --> 20:13.000
What is it? Guaranteed Additions are fixed bonuses declared in advance by LIC in select plans.

20:13.000 --> 20:21.000
Unlike Reversionary or Loyalty bonuses, Gaz are assured and mentioned in the plan brochure itself.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Real-world example

20:23.000 --> 20:33.000
Say Nina buys a policy that gives a guaranteed addition of 50 rupee per 1000 rupees some assured for the first 5 years.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
Her sum assured is 4 lakhs rupees. So, she will get.

20:39.000 --> 20:46.000
50 rupees times 4 lakhs rupees 1000 times 5 is equal to 1 lakh rupees.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
This amount is guaranteed and added to the maturity death benefit.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
28. Next Last Near Birthday

20:55.000 --> 21:07.000
What is it? In LIC policies, your age is used for premium calculation but how its calculated depends on whether the plan uses last birthday,

21:07.000 --> 21:16.000
next birthday or nearest birthday. Last birthday, your age as of your last birthday.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Next birthday, your age on your upcoming birthday.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
nearest birthday, the age you are closest to.

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
If your half birthday has passed, LIC may count your next birthday.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Real-world example

21:33.000 --> 21:40.000
If today is 30th July and your birthday is 1st August and you are 29 now.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Last Birthday is equal to 29.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Next Birthday is equal to 30.

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
nearest birthday is equal to 30 because your birthday is just 2 days away.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
LIC often uses nearest birthday for most plans.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
29 Proposal Forms, 300, 340, 360

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
What is it?

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
LIC uses different proposal forms based on the type of insurance plan.

22:13.000 --> 22:20.000
Form 300 used for regular life insurance proposals like endowment whole life.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
Form 340 used for proposals under children's plans like Jeevan Tarun.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Form 360 used for proposals under health insurance policies.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Real-world example

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
If Raj wants to buy a standard LIC endowment policy, he will fill out proposal form 300.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
But if he wants to buy a child plan for his son, he will be asked to use Form 340.

22:49.000 --> 22:56.000
Similarly, for health specific plans like Jeevan Aroga, Form 360 is used.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Counter-clockwise arrows example to understand.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Let's say, your early premium is equal to 10,000 rupees.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
It is an endowment policy, traditional plan.

24:06.000 --> 24:16.000
Year 1 GST is equal to 4.5% 10,000 rupees times 4.5% is equal to 450 rupees.

24:16.000 --> 24:28.000
From year to onward, GST is equal to 0.25% 10,000 rupees times 2.25% is equal to 225 rupees.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So, you will pay.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Year 1 total premium is equal to 10,450 rupees.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Busts in silhouette who pays the GST.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
The policy holder, you, pays the GST.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
It is included in the premium amount shown in receipts or premium notices.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
Always check whether the GST is included in the premium breakdown.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Is GST refundable?

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
No, for individual policy holders, GST paid is not refundable or climbable.

25:09.000 --> 25:18.000
However, corporate buyers for key-man insurance, for example, may claim input tax credit as per their business accounting.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
Right-pointing magnifying glass is GST applicable on loan or surrender?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
No.

25:26.000 --> 25:34.000

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
31 relationship between parameters

25:38.000 --> 25:49.000
Let's explore the interrelationship between the following life insurance parameters one by one by picking every possible combination of the six variables.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Some are short, some.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Policy turn.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Age.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Premium.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Riders.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Premium paying term, ppt.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
GST.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
White heavy check mark 1.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Some are short and premium.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
Relationship, when the some are short increases, the premium increases.

26:12.000 --> 26:19.000
Explanation, some are short is the guaranteed amount payable on death or maturity.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
Naturally, higher coverage means higher financial risk for the insurer, hence they charge a higher premium.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
Example, for a 30-year-old buying a term plan for 20 years.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
Certain lakh rupees annual premium 3,000 rupees.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
Certain lakh rupees annual premium 5,500 rupees.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
White heavy check mark 2.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Some are short and policy term.

26:48.000 --> 26:59.000
Relationship as policy term increases, the total risk exposure time increases, so the overall premium and sometimes underwriting is higher.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
Explanation, longer policy term is equal to insurer at risk for a longer period is equal to higher cost.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Example.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Certain lakh rupees for 10 years.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Low premium.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
Certain lakh rupees for 30 years higher premium.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
White heavy check mark 3.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Some are short and age.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
Relationship, higher the age, higher the premium for the same size.

27:29.000 --> 27:39.000
Explanation, 825-year-old is less risky than a 50-year-old, so the same size costs more at older ages.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Example.

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
Certain lakh rupees at age 25 premium 3,000 rupees.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
Certain lakh rupees at age 50 premium 10,000 rupees.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
White heavy check mark 4.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Some are short and riders.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
Relationship riders are add-ons to the base some are short and they attract extra premium.

28:03.000 --> 28:10.000
Explanation, adding riders increases the total protection, so premium increases.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Example.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
With a 10 lakh rupees start.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
No rider 5,000 rupees.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
White heavy check mark 5.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Some are short and PPT.

28:26.000 --> 28:35.000
Relationship lower PPT is equal to higher annual premium, but longer PPT is equal to smaller annual installments.

28:35.000 --> 28:42.000
Explanation, if you spread the payment over more years, each installment is smaller.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Example.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Certain lakh rupees.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
PPT 10 years, 6000 rupees per year.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
White heavy check mark 6.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Some are short and GST.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
Relationship GST is a percentage of the premium not SA.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Explanation.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
The more the SA, the more the premium, so GST amount increases.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Example.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Premium 10,000 rupees GST.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
4.5% first year is equal to 450 rupees.

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
Premium 20,000 rupees GST is equal to 900 rupees.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Policy turn and premium.

29:32.000 --> 29:38.000
Relationship longer the turn, higher the total premium, not necessarily per year.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
Explanation, even if per year premium is lower, you pay it for more years.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Example.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
10,000 rupees per year, for 10 years, is equal to 1 lakh rupees.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
7,000 rupees per year, for 20 years, is equal to 1 lakh 40,000 rupees.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
White heavy check mark.
