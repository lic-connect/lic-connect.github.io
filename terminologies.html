                <h2>A</h2>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Accidental Death Benefit</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An add-on (rider) to a life insurance policy that pays an additional sum to the beneficiary if the insured dies as a result of an accident.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Rohan buys a ₹50 lakh life insurance policy and adds a ₹25 lakh Accidental Death Benefit rider. If he dies in a car accident, his family receives ₹75 lakh. If he dies from a heart attack, they receive ₹50 lakh.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Accumulation Period</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The phase of an annuity or cash value life insurance policy during which the policyholder pays premiums and the account value grows, before the payout (annuitization) phase begins.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah, age 40, buys a deferred annuity. The 20 years she spends paying premiums into the annuity before she retires at age 60 is the accumulation period.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Accumulation Value</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The total value in a policy's cash value account, including all premiums paid and interest or investment gains credited, before any surrender charges are deducted.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After 10 years, David's universal life policy shows an accumulation value of ₹2 lakh. If he were to surrender it, he would receive this amount minus any applicable surrender fees.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuarial Assumptions</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Predictions made by actuaries regarding future events affecting an insurance policy, such as mortality rates, interest earnings, and policy persistency, used to calculate premiums and reserves.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To price a new policy, an insurer's actuaries assume a 5% average annual return on investments and use a specific mortality table to predict how many policyholders will pass away each year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuarial Equity</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The principle that policyholders with similar risk characteristics should be charged similar premiums for the same coverage.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Two 35-year-old healthy, non-smoking males applying for the same life insurance policy should be offered identical premium rates due to the principle of actuarial equity.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuarial Table</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A statistical chart showing probabilities of life events, such as a mortality table which shows the probability of death at each age.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An insurance company refers to its actuarial table (specifically, a mortality table) to determine that a 40-year-old male has a 0.2% chance of dying in the next year, which helps them calculate the cost of his insurance.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuary</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A professional who uses mathematical and statistical models to analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty, primarily for pricing insurance policies and setting reserves.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When LIC launches a new plan, an actuary is responsible for calculating how much the premium should be to ensure the company can cover all future claims and expenses.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Adjusted Premium</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A premium that has been modified from the standard rate to account for special circumstances, such as a substandard risk rating or the addition of riders.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The standard premium for a policy is ₹10,000. Because the applicant is a professional stunt driver, the insurer adds a ₹2,000 surcharge, making the adjusted premium ₹12,000 per year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Admitted Assets</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Assets of an insurance company that are permitted by state law to be included in the company's financial statements for determining its solvency.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An insurer's portfolio of government bonds and blue-chip stocks are considered admitted assets, while an old, unappraised office building might be considered a non-admitted asset by regulators.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Agent</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A licensed individual who sells and services insurance policies on behalf of an insurance company.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Sunita meets with Mr. Verma, an LIC agent, who explains the benefits of different plans and helps her fill out the application form for a new policy.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Aggregate Limit</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The maximum total amount an insurance company will pay for all covered losses during a specified policy period.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A small group health policy might have an aggregate limit of ₹1 crore per year, meaning the insurer will not pay more than that total amount for all claims from all members of the group in that year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Aggregate Mortality Table</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A mortality table based on the combined death rates of a large group of people, without differentiation for specific risk factors other than age and sex.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A national statistics office might publish an aggregate mortality table for the entire country's population, which actuaries can use as a baseline before creating more specific tables for insured lives.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Alternative Settlement Option</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Any method of receiving policy proceeds other than a single lump-sum payment, such as receiving payments over a fixed period or for life.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of taking a ₹1 crore death benefit as a lump sum, the beneficiary chooses an alternative settlement option to receive ₹1 lakh every month for the next 10 years.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annual Renewable Term</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of term life insurance that guarantees the policyholder the right to renew the policy each year without evidence of insurability, though the premium may increase annually with age.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Ken buys an Annual Renewable Term policy. His premium is low in the first year, but it increases every year on his policy anniversary as he gets older. He doesn't need to take a new medical exam to continue the cover.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annual Statement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A detailed financial report that an insurance company must file with the state insurance department each year, showing its assets, liabilities, and overall financial condition.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The insurance regulator, IRDAI, reviews LIC's Annual Statement to ensure the company has enough funds and is financially stable enough to pay all its policyholders' future claims.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annuitant</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The person, usually the policy owner, who receives the periodic income payments from an annuity contract.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Mrs. Kapoor buys a pension plan from LIC. When she retires and starts receiving her monthly pension, she becomes the annuitant.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annuity</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A financial product that pays out a fixed stream of payments to an individual, primarily used as an income stream for retirees.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Raj invests a lump sum of ₹50 lakh into an immediate annuity plan. The insurance company then starts paying him a guaranteed pension of ₹30,000 every month for the rest of his life.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Application</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The form filled out by an individual seeking insurance, providing personal information and medical history that the insurer uses to underwrite the policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To get a life insurance policy, Aisha must complete a 10-page application where she answers questions about her health, occupation, and lifestyle.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Assignee</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The person or entity (e.g., a bank) to whom the rights of a life insurance policy are transferred by the policy owner (the assignor).</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When Ajay takes a home loan, the bank becomes the assignee of his life insurance policy. If Ajay defaults, the bank can claim the policy's value.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Assignment</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The legal transfer of a policyholder's rights, title, and interest in a policy to another person or entity.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Priya needs a business loan. The bank agrees, but requires collateral. Priya completes a formal Assignment of her life insurance policy to the bank, giving them rights to the policy's value until the loan is repaid.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Assignor</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The policy owner who transfers their rights in a life insurance policy to an assignee.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> In the loan scenario, Priya is the policy owner who transfers her rights, making her the assignor. The bank, which receives the rights, is the assignee.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Automatic Premium Loan</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A provision in a cash value policy that allows the insurer to automatically borrow from the policy's cash value to pay a premium that is past due, preventing the policy from lapsing.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Meena forgets to pay her ₹5,000 quarterly premium. Instead of the policy lapsing, the insurance company automatically takes a ₹5,000 loan from her policy's cash value to cover the payment, keeping the policy active.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Automatic Reinstatement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A policy provision that allows for the automatic restoration of coverage under certain conditions after a claim has been paid, often seen with specific riders.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A critical illness rider pays out on a first heart attack. An automatic reinstatement provision might allow the rider to become active again after one year, offering coverage for a different future illness.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Aviation Exclusion</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A policy clause that excludes coverage for death occurring while flying in a non-commercial aircraft.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Tom is a hobbyist pilot. His life insurance policy has an aviation exclusion, meaning if he dies while flying his private plane, his family will not receive the death benefit.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Avoidance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The act of an insurer declaring a policy void from its inception, usually due to material misrepresentation or concealment by the applicant.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If an applicant fails to disclose a recent cancer diagnosis and the insurer finds out, the insurer can execute an avoidance of the contract, treating it as if it never existed.</p></div></div>

                <h2>B</h2>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Backdating</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The practice of making a policy effective on a date prior to the application date, often to secure a lower premium based on a younger age.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Amit's birthday was on May 10th, which moved him into a higher age bracket for premiums. On May 25th, he applies for a policy and requests to backdate it to May 1st, allowing him to get the lower premium rate of his previous age.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Beneficiary</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The person, people, trust, or institution designated to receive the death benefit from a life insurance policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When Ravi buys a life insurance policy, he names his wife, Priya, as the beneficiary. If Ravi passes away, Priya will receive the policy money.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Beneficiary Clause</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The section of the insurance policy that specifies who will receive the policy proceeds.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> In Maria's policy document, the Beneficiary Clause clearly states: "Primary Beneficiary: John D'Souza (Spouse), Contingent Beneficiary: Anna D'Souza (Daughter)."</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Binding Agreement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A temporary insurance agreement that provides coverage from the date of application until the policy is officially issued or declined.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When an agent accepts the first premium, they might issue a binding agreement, meaning the applicant is insured from that moment, even if the formal policy document takes weeks to arrive.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Binding Receipt</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A receipt given for a premium payment that binds the insurance company to provide coverage starting from the date of the receipt, subject to the terms of the receipt.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Ali pays his first premium on June 1st and gets a binding receipt. He tragically dies in an accident on June 5th. Even though the policy wasn't formally issued, the insurer must pay the claim because the binding receipt provided immediate coverage.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Blanket Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A single policy that covers a group of people, such as employees of a company or members of an organization.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A university purchases a blanket insurance policy to cover all its students for accidents that might occur on campus or during university-sponsored trips.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Bonus (Reversionary, Terminal)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A share of the insurer's profits paid to holders of participating policies. A reversionary bonus is declared annually and added to the sum assured. A terminal bonus is paid once, at maturity or death.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Every year, Deepak gets a statement that a reversionary bonus of ₹20,000 has been added to his endowment policy. When the policy matures after 20 years, LIC pays a final, one-time terminal bonus of ₹50,000 on top of all the accumulated bonuses.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Book Reserve</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The amount of money an insurance company sets aside as a liability in its financial books to cover future claims.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> For every active policy, an insurer's accounting department maintains a book reserve, which is the calculated amount they need to have invested to fulfill their future promise to pay the claim.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Broker</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A licensed insurance professional who represents the client (the buyer) and can sell policies from multiple insurance companies.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of going directly to LIC, Fatima consults an insurance broker. The broker shows her and compares life insurance plans from LIC, HDFC Life, and ICICI Prudential, helping her choose the best fit.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Burial Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of final expense insurance with a small death benefit, specifically intended to cover funeral and burial costs.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An 80-year-old widow buys a ₹50,000 burial insurance policy so that her children won't have to worry about funeral expenses when she passes away.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Business Continuation Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Insurance used to ensure a business can continue operating after the death or disability of a key owner or employee, often funding a buy-sell agreement.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A successful restaurant is famous because of its head chef. The restaurant owners buy a business continuation insurance policy on the chef's life to provide funds to hire a replacement and cover losses if the chef were to die unexpectedly.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Buy-Sell Agreement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A legal contract that outlines how a deceased or departing partner's share of a business will be bought out by the remaining partners, often funded by life insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Two business partners, Sameer and Arjun, sign a buy-sell agreement. They each buy a life insurance policy on the other's life. If Sameer dies, the insurance payout gives Arjun the cash to buy Sameer's half of the business from his family.</p></div></div>
            </div>

            <!-- === Section C === -->
            <div class="alphabet-section">
                <h2>C</h2>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Captive Agent</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An insurance agent who works exclusively for one insurance company and sells only their policies.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Mr. Sharma is a captive agent for LIC. This means he can only sell you LIC policies and cannot offer you a plan from Max Life or Bajaj Allianz.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cash Surrender Value</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The amount of money a policyholder receives if they voluntarily terminate a permanent life insurance policy before its maturity. It's the accumulated cash value minus any surrender charges.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After paying premiums for 10 years, Geeta's policy has an accumulated cash value of ₹1,50,000 and a surrender charge of ₹10,000. If she cancels the policy, her cash surrender value is ₹1,40,000.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cash Value Accumulation Test (CVAT)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>One of two IRS tests a policy must pass to qualify as life insurance for tax purposes. It limits the cash value relative to the death benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The insurer designs a universal life policy ensuring that the cash value never exceeds a certain percentage of the death benefit at any given age, thereby passing the CVAT and retaining its tax advantages.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Catastrophic Loss</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A severe loss that is very large and unexpected, such as from a natural disaster or pandemic, affecting many policyholders at once.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A major earthquake in a city would be a catastrophic loss for an insurance company, as they would face a huge number of simultaneous claims for life, health, and property damage.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Ceding Company</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The insurance company that transfers a portion of its risk to another insurer (the reinsurer) in a reinsurance agreement.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> ABC Insurance sells a massive ₹50 crore policy to a corporation. Since this is too much risk, ABC Insurance (the ceding company) pays a premium to XYZ Reinsurance to cover ₹30 crore of that risk.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Certificate of Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A document issued to a member of a group insurance plan, providing evidence of coverage and summarizing the benefits.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When a new employee joins a company, they don't get a full policy document for the group life cover. Instead, they receive a certificate of insurance confirming they are covered for ₹20 lakh.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Claim</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A formal request by a beneficiary to an insurance company to pay the death benefit upon the death of the insured.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After her husband's death, Mrs. Verma fills out the required forms, attaches the death certificate, and submits them to the insurance company. This process is filing a claim.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Clause</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A specific section or provision within an insurance policy that details a particular condition, right, or exclusion.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The "Suicide Clause" in a life insurance policy is a specific paragraph that explains the company's rules and payout conditions if the insured's death is due to suicide.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Co-insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A provision where the policyholder and the insurer share the cost of a covered loss in a specified ratio (e.g., 80/20). More common in health insurance than life insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Rina's health insurance has an 80/20 co-insurance clause. For a ₹1 lakh hospital bill, the insurer pays ₹80,000, and Rina pays the remaining ₹20,000.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Co-insured</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An additional person covered under an insurance policy alongside the primary insured.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> On a joint life insurance policy, both the husband and wife are named as insured persons. The wife is a co-insured on the policy taken by the husband.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Collateral Assignment</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The temporary transfer of a policy's cash value and/or death benefit to a lender as security for a loan. The assignment ends when the loan is repaid.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To secure a business loan of ₹20 lakh, Vikram makes a collateral assignment of his ₹50 lakh life insurance policy to the bank. The bank's rights are limited to the loan amount, and the assignment is canceled once he repays the loan.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Commission</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The fee paid by an insurance company to its agent or broker for selling a policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When an agent sells a policy with a ₹25,000 annual premium, the insurance company pays them a percentage of that premium as their commission for the sale.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Commutation</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The process of paying a future stream of income (like an annuity) as a single lump sum.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> At retirement, a policyholder is entitled to a pension of ₹10,000 per month for life. They choose to exercise commutation for one-third of it, receiving a single lump sum payment upfront and a reduced pension of ₹6,667 per month.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Commutation Function</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Actuarial symbols used as a shorthand to simplify the calculation of premiums and reserves.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of writing a long, complex formula, an actuary uses a standard commutation function like 'Dx' or 'Nx' to represent a specific value in their calculations, which is understood by other actuaries.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Concealment</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The intentional failure of an applicant to disclose a material fact to the insurer, which can lead to the policy being voided.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> On his insurance application, David doesn't mention that he is a regular smoker. This is concealment, and if he dies from a smoking-related illness, the insurer could refuse to pay the claim.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Conditional Receipt</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A receipt given when the first premium is paid with the application. It makes coverage effective from that date, provided the applicant is found to be insurable as a standard risk.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Anjali applies for a policy, pays the first premium, and gets a conditional receipt. If she is found to be healthy during underwriting, her coverage will be considered to have started from the date of the receipt, not the date the policy was finally approved.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Consideration</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A fundamental element of a legal contract. For the policyholder, it's the premium payments and statements in the application. For the insurer, it's the promise to pay the benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> In an insurance contract, the policyholder's consideration is the premium they agree to pay. The insurance company's consideration is its promise to pay the death benefit as per the contract terms.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Contestability Period</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A limited period (usually the first two years of a policy) during which the insurer can investigate and dispute the validity of the policy, typically on grounds of material misrepresentation.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If a person dies 18 months after buying a policy, the insurer can investigate their application for any lies.

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Limited Payment Life</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of whole life insurance where premiums are paid for a limited number of years (e.g., 20 years or until age 65), but the coverage remains in force for the insured's entire life.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A person buys a "20-Pay" limited payment life policy. They pay premiums for only 20 years (from age 30 to 50). After age 50, they pay nothing more, but the life insurance coverage continues for the rest of their life.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Living Benefits</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Benefits from a life insurance policy that the insured can access while still alive, such as loans, surrender value, or accelerated death benefits for terminal illness.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After being diagnosed with a terminal illness, John uses the living benefits feature of his policy to access 50% of his death benefit immediately to pay for medical care and travel.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Loan Against Policy</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A loan taken by the policy owner from the insurer, using the policy's cash value as collateral. It does not have to be repaid, but any outstanding balance plus interest will be deducted from the death benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Needing funds for a home repair, Sumit takes a loan against his policy of ₹1 lakh. When he passes away a few years later with the loan still unpaid, his nominee receives the death benefit minus the ₹1 lakh loan and any accrued interest.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Loading</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The amount added to the net premium to cover the insurer's operating expenses, commissions, taxes, and a margin for profit and contingencies.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The pure cost (net premium) to cover claims for a policy is ₹800. The insurer adds a loading of ₹200 to cover agent commissions, office rent, and profit, making the final gross premium ₹1,000.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Long Duration Contract</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An insurance contract, such as life insurance, that is expected to remain in force for an extended period.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A whole life insurance policy is a long duration contract because it is designed to last for many decades, unlike a one-year car insurance policy.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Long-Term Care Rider</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An add-on that allows the policyholder to accelerate a portion of their death benefit to pay for long-term care services if they become chronically ill.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An elderly woman can no longer perform daily activities like eating and dressing by herself. She activates the long-term care rider on her life policy, which pays her a monthly benefit to cover the cost of a full-time nurse.</p></div></div>

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Medical Information Bureau (MIB)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A non-profit cooperative data exchange for North American insurance companies. It stores coded information from previous insurance applications to help prevent fraud and misrepresentation.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An applicant applies to Insurer A and declares a health condition. He then applies to Insurer B and hides it. Insurer B checks the MIB database and sees a code indicating the condition from the first application, which helps them uncover the fraud.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Medical Underwriting</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The process of an insurer evaluating an applicant's medical history, health status, and other health-related information to determine their risk profile and insurability.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The medical underwriting team reviewed the applicant's blood test results, doctor's reports, and family health history before approving his policy at a standard rate.</p></div></div>

At the time of a claim, the insurer discovers this. Instead of denying the claim, they use the misstatement of age clause to calculate and pay a lower death benefit—the amount the premium would have bought for a 45-year-old.</p></div></div>

Her friend chose the 'yearly' mode and pays a single, larger premium once a year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Modified Endowment Contract (MEC)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A life insurance policy that has been funded with more money than allowed under federal tax laws (failing the 7-pay test). MECs lose some of the tax advantages of regular life insurance; withdrawals and loans are potentially taxable and subject to penalties.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A policy requires a premium of ₹1 lakh per year. The policyholder decides to pay ₹10 lakh in the first year. This overfunding causes the policy to be classified as a Modified Endowment Contract, and any future withdrawals will be taxed differently.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Morale Hazard</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A risk attitude of indifference or carelessness towards loss because of the existence of insurance. For example, engaging in risky behavior because "insurance will cover it."</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A person with excellent health insurance might be less inclined to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen, thinking "if I get sick, my insurance will pay for it." This attitude is a morale hazard.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Morbidity Rate</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The frequency or incidence of a disease or illness within a population. It's a key factor in pricing health and disability insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To set the premium for a critical illness policy, an actuary studies the morbidity rate for cancer to predict how many policyholders out of 1,000 are likely to be diagnosed with the disease each year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Mortality Charge</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The cost of the pure life insurance protection in a policy. In universal life, it is a monthly deduction from the cash value to cover the death benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Out of a ₹5,000 monthly premium for a ULIP, ₹4,500 is invested, and ₹500 is deducted as the mortality charge to provide the life cover for that month.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Mortality Risk</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The risk that an individual will die sooner than expected, which is the primary risk an insurer assumes in a life insurance policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An insurance company faces mortality risk because if a large number of its policyholders die earlier than projected, the company will have to pay out more in claims than it collected in premiums.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Mortality Table</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A statistical chart that shows the death rate at each age, based on a large population, used by actuaries to calculate premiums and reserves.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An actuary uses a mortality table to determine the net premium for a 30-year-old applicant, noting the probability of death for each year of the policy term.</p></div></div>

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Non-Participating Policy</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A policy that does not pay dividends to the policyholder. The premiums are generally lower than for participating policies.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A pure term insurance plan is a non-participating policy.

The applicant "offers" to buy insurance by submitting an application and premium. The insurer "accepts" the offer by issuing the policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When you submit a signed application form with a cheque for the first premium, you are making an offer. When the insurance company issues the policy document, it is an acceptance of your offer, and the contract is formed.</p></div></div>

These additions have their own cash value and increase the policy's total death benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of taking her annual dividend of ₹5,000 in cash, Sarah uses it to buy paid-up additions. This adds ₹20,000 of permanent life cover to her existing policy, increasing her total death benefit.</p></div></div>

The applicant is assigned a "table" (e.g., Table B or Table 4), which corresponds to a certain percentage increase over the standard premium rate.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Due to a health condition, an applicant is given a "Table 2" rating, which means their premium will be the standard rate plus an additional 50%.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Target Premium</a><div class="term-definition"><p>In a universal life policy, this is the premium suggested by the insurer that, if paid consistently, should keep the policy in force for a long duration under the policy's current assumptions.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The insurer calculates a target premium of ₹3,000 per month for a ULIP. While the policyholder can pay more or less, paying the target premium gives a reasonable expectation that the policy will not lapse prematurely.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Tax-Free Death Benefit</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A key feature of life insurance, meaning that the death benefit paid to the beneficiary is generally not subject to federal income tax.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A nominee receives a death benefit of ₹1 crore.

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Term Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of life insurance that provides coverage for a specific period (the "term"). It pays a death benefit only if the insured dies during that term and typically has no cash value.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A 30-year-old buys a term insurance policy for 30 years. If she passes away anytime before age 60, her family gets the death benefit. If she lives past 60, the policy expires and pays nothing.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Term Rider</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An add-on to a permanent life insurance policy that provides additional, temporary term insurance coverage for a specified period.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A person has a ₹20 lakh whole life policy.

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Total and Permanent Disability (TPD)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A condition of being permanently unable to work due to illness or injury. Many policies have riders that provide benefits, such as waiver of premium or a lump-sum payment, for TPD.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After an accident resulted in the loss of both arms, the insured was declared to have a Total and Permanent Disability, which triggered the TPD benefit in his insurance policy.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Trust</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A legal entity created to hold and manage assets on behalf of a beneficiary. Life insurance policies are often owned by or have their benefits paid to a trust for estate planning purposes.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A couple sets up a trust and names it as the beneficiary of their life insurance policy to ensure the funds are managed professionally for their minor children if both parents were to pass away.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Trustee</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The person or institution responsible for administering a trust according to its terms.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A bank is appointed as the trustee for a family trust.

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Underinsured</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A state of having some insurance coverage, but not enough to adequately cover the potential financial loss.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A person who earns ₹20 lakh a year but only has a ₹10 lakh life insurance policy is significantly underinsured, as the death benefit would not be enough to replace their income for their family.</p></div></div>

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Underwriting</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The comprehensive process an insurer uses to evaluate an applicant's risk and decide whether to issue a policy and on what terms.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The underwriting process for a large policy involved a medical exam, a review of financial documents, and a telephone interview to assess the applicant's overall risk profile.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Unearned Commission</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The portion of an agent's commission that must be returned to the insurer if the policy lapses or is canceled within a certain period after being issued.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An agent received a ₹10,000 commission for a policy. The client canceled the policy during the free-look period. The agent has to return the full ₹10,000 to the company as it is now an unearned commission.</p></div></div>

If the policy is canceled, this portion is typically refunded.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A policyholder pays a ₹12,000 annual premium in January but cancels the policy at the end of June. The insurer must refund the unearned premium of ₹6,000, which covers the second half of the year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Uniform Policy Provisions</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A set of standard clauses and provisions that are required by law to be included in all life insurance policies in a given state to protect consumers.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The 'Grace Period' and 'Incontestability Clause' are uniform policy provisions mandated by the regulator, so they are found in every life insurance policy, regardless of the company.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Universal Life Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of flexible permanent life insurance that combines a term insurance component with a tax-deferred savings element. Policyholders can adjust their premiums and death benefit as their needs change.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> John buys a universal life policy. In years when he has extra income, he pays a higher premium to build cash value faster. In lean years, he pays a lower premium, and the policy uses the existing cash value to cover its costs.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Unpaid Premium</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A premium that is past its due date. If it is not paid by the end of the grace period, the policy will lapse.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A notice from the insurer states, "We are yet to receive your unpaid premium of ₹5,000 which was due on July 1st. Please pay before the grace period ends to avoid policy lapse."</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) Fees</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The standard amount that medical providers in a certain geographic area typically charge for a specific service. Insurers often use UCR to determine how much to reimburse for claims. More common in health insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A hospital charges ₹1.5 lakh for a surgery, but the UCR fee for that surgery in that city is only ₹1.2 lakh. The insurer will only consider ₹1.2 lakh as the eligible expense for calculating the claim payout.</p></div></div>

The death benefit and cash value can fluctuate based on the performance of these investments. The policyholder bears the investment risk.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A policyholder allocates her premium in a variable life policy to a 'Blue Chip Equity Fund' sub-account. If the fund performs well, her cash value and death benefit increase. If it performs poorly, they decrease.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Variable Universal Life (VUL)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A policy that combines the flexible premiums and death benefits of universal life with the investment sub-accounts of variable life.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A VUL policy allows a policyholder to choose how much premium to pay each year (flexibility of Universal Life) and also which stock or bond funds to invest that premium in (investment choice of Variable Life).</p></div></div>

An employee becomes "fully vested" when they are entitled to 100% of the employer's contributions.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A company has a 3-year vesting period for its pension plan. An employee who leaves after 2 years forfeits the employer's contribution. An employee who leaves after 3 years is fully vested and can take the entire amount, including the employer's contribution.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Voluntary Life Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Optional life insurance coverage offered through an employer where the employee pays the full premium. It's a common part of a group benefits package.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An employer provides a basic ₹5 lakh cover for free.

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Waiver of Deductible</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A provision in some policies that waives the deductible if the loss is particularly severe. More common in property insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A health policy has a waiver of deductible for major accidents. If the policyholder has a small bill, they pay the deductible. If they are in a severe car crash with a huge bill, the company waives the deductible and pays from the first rupee.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Waiver of Premium</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A common rider that waives the policyholder's obligation to pay premiums if they become totally disabled. The policy remains in force as if the premiums were being paid.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After a disabling illness, a policyholder activates the waiver of premium rider.
