                <h2>A</h2>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Accidental Death Benefit</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An add-on (rider) to a life insurance policy that pays an additional sum to the beneficiary if the insured dies as a result of an accident.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Rohan buys a ₹50 lakh life insurance policy and adds a ₹25 lakh Accidental Death Benefit rider. If he dies in a car accident, his family receives ₹75 lakh. If he dies from a heart attack, they receive ₹50 lakh.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Accumulation Period</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The phase of an annuity or cash value life insurance policy during which the policyholder pays premiums and the account value grows, before the payout (annuitization) phase begins.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah, age 40, buys a deferred annuity. The 20 years she spends paying premiums into the annuity before she retires at age 60 is the accumulation period.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Accumulation Value</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The total value in a policy's cash value account, including all premiums paid and interest or investment gains credited, before any surrender charges are deducted.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After 10 years, David's universal life policy shows an accumulation value of ₹2 lakh. If he were to surrender it, he would receive this amount minus any applicable surrender fees.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuarial Assumptions</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Predictions made by actuaries regarding future events affecting an insurance policy, such as mortality rates, interest earnings, and policy persistency, used to calculate premiums and reserves.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To price a new policy, an insurer's actuaries assume a 5% average annual return on investments and use a specific mortality table to predict how many policyholders will pass away each year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuarial Equity</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The principle that policyholders with similar risk characteristics should be charged similar premiums for the same coverage.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Two 35-year-old healthy, non-smoking males applying for the same life insurance policy should be offered identical premium rates due to the principle of actuarial equity.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuarial Table</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A statistical chart showing probabilities of life events, such as a mortality table which shows the probability of death at each age.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An insurance company refers to its actuarial table (specifically, a mortality table) to determine that a 40-year-old male has a 0.2% chance of dying in the next year, which helps them calculate the cost of his insurance.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Actuary</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A professional who uses mathematical and statistical models to analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty, primarily for pricing insurance policies and setting reserves.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When LIC launches a new plan, an actuary is responsible for calculating how much the premium should be to ensure the company can cover all future claims and expenses.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Adjusted Premium</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A premium that has been modified from the standard rate to account for special circumstances, such as a substandard risk rating or the addition of riders.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The standard premium for a policy is ₹10,000. Because the applicant is a professional stunt driver, the insurer adds a ₹2,000 surcharge, making the adjusted premium ₹12,000 per year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Admitted Assets</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Assets of an insurance company that are permitted by state law to be included in the company's financial statements for determining its solvency.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An insurer's portfolio of government bonds and blue-chip stocks are considered admitted assets, while an old, unappraised office building might be considered a non-admitted asset by regulators.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Agent</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A licensed individual who sells and services insurance policies on behalf of an insurance company.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Sunita meets with Mr. Verma, an LIC agent, who explains the benefits of different plans and helps her fill out the application form for a new policy.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Aggregate Limit</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The maximum total amount an insurance company will pay for all covered losses during a specified policy period.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A small group health policy might have an aggregate limit of ₹1 crore per year, meaning the insurer will not pay more than that total amount for all claims from all members of the group in that year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Aggregate Mortality Table</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A mortality table based on the combined death rates of a large group of people, without differentiation for specific risk factors other than age and sex.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A national statistics office might publish an aggregate mortality table for the entire country's population, which actuaries can use as a baseline before creating more specific tables for insured lives.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Alternative Settlement Option</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Any method of receiving policy proceeds other than a single lump-sum payment, such as receiving payments over a fixed period or for life.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of taking a ₹1 crore death benefit as a lump sum, the beneficiary chooses an alternative settlement option to receive ₹1 lakh every month for the next 10 years.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annual Renewable Term</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of term life insurance that guarantees the policyholder the right to renew the policy each year without evidence of insurability, though the premium may increase annually with age.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Ken buys an Annual Renewable Term policy. His premium is low in the first year, but it increases every year on his policy anniversary as he gets older. He doesn't need to take a new medical exam to continue the cover.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annual Statement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A detailed financial report that an insurance company must file with the state insurance department each year, showing its assets, liabilities, and overall financial condition.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The insurance regulator, IRDAI, reviews LIC's Annual Statement to ensure the company has enough funds and is financially stable enough to pay all its policyholders' future claims.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annuitant</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The person, usually the policy owner, who receives the periodic income payments from an annuity contract.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Mrs. Kapoor buys a pension plan from LIC. When she retires and starts receiving her monthly pension, she becomes the annuitant.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Annuity</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A financial product that pays out a fixed stream of payments to an individual, primarily used as an income stream for retirees.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Raj invests a lump sum of ₹50 lakh into an immediate annuity plan. The insurance company then starts paying him a guaranteed pension of ₹30,000 every month for the rest of his life.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Application</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The form filled out by an individual seeking insurance, providing personal information and medical history that the insurer uses to underwrite the policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To get a life insurance policy, Aisha must complete a 10-page application where she answers questions about her health, occupation, and lifestyle.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Assignee</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The person or entity (e.g., a bank) to whom the rights of a life insurance policy are transferred by the policy owner (the assignor).</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When Ajay takes a home loan, the bank becomes the assignee of his life insurance policy. If Ajay defaults, the bank can claim the policy's value.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Assignment</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The legal transfer of a policyholder's rights, title, and interest in a policy to another person or entity.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Priya needs a business loan. The bank agrees, but requires collateral. Priya completes a formal Assignment of her life insurance policy to the bank, giving them rights to the policy's value until the loan is repaid.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Assignor</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The policy owner who transfers their rights in a life insurance policy to an assignee.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> In the loan scenario, Priya is the policy owner who transfers her rights, making her the assignor. The bank, which receives the rights, is the assignee.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Automatic Premium Loan</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A provision in a cash value policy that allows the insurer to automatically borrow from the policy's cash value to pay a premium that is past due, preventing the policy from lapsing.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Meena forgets to pay her ₹5,000 quarterly premium. Instead of the policy lapsing, the insurance company automatically takes a ₹5,000 loan from her policy's cash value to cover the payment, keeping the policy active.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Automatic Reinstatement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A policy provision that allows for the automatic restoration of coverage under certain conditions after a claim has been paid, often seen with specific riders.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A critical illness rider pays out on a first heart attack. An automatic reinstatement provision might allow the rider to become active again after one year, offering coverage for a different future illness.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Aviation Exclusion</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A policy clause that excludes coverage for death occurring while flying in a non-commercial aircraft.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Tom is a hobbyist pilot. His life insurance policy has an aviation exclusion, meaning if he dies while flying his private plane, his family will not receive the death benefit.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Avoidance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The act of an insurer declaring a policy void from its inception, usually due to material misrepresentation or concealment by the applicant.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If an applicant fails to disclose a recent cancer diagnosis and the insurer finds out, the insurer can execute an avoidance of the contract, treating it as if it never existed.</p></div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="alphabet-section">
                <h2>B</h2>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Backdating</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The practice of making a policy effective on a date prior to the application date, often to secure a lower premium based on a younger age.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Amit's birthday was on May 10th, which moved him into a higher age bracket for premiums. On May 25th, he applies for a policy and requests to backdate it to May 1st, allowing him to get the lower premium rate of his previous age.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Beneficiary</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The person, people, trust, or institution designated to receive the death benefit from a life insurance policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When Ravi buys a life insurance policy, he names his wife, Priya, as the beneficiary. If Ravi passes away, Priya will receive the policy money.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Beneficiary Clause</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The section of the insurance policy that specifies who will receive the policy proceeds.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> In Maria's policy document, the Beneficiary Clause clearly states: "Primary Beneficiary: John D'Souza (Spouse), Contingent Beneficiary: Anna D'Souza (Daughter)."</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Binding Agreement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A temporary insurance agreement that provides coverage from the date of application until the policy is officially issued or declined.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When an agent accepts the first premium, they might issue a binding agreement, meaning the applicant is insured from that moment, even if the formal policy document takes weeks to arrive.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Binding Receipt</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A receipt given for a premium payment that binds the insurance company to provide coverage starting from the date of the receipt, subject to the terms of the receipt.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Ali pays his first premium on June 1st and gets a binding receipt. He tragically dies in an accident on June 5th. Even though the policy wasn't formally issued, the insurer must pay the claim because the binding receipt provided immediate coverage.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Blanket Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A single policy that covers a group of people, such as employees of a company or members of an organization.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A university purchases a blanket insurance policy to cover all its students for accidents that might occur on campus or during university-sponsored trips.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Bonus (Reversionary, Terminal)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A share of the insurer's profits paid to holders of participating policies. A reversionary bonus is declared annually and added to the sum assured. A terminal bonus is paid once, at maturity or death.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Every year, Deepak gets a statement that a reversionary bonus of ₹20,000 has been added to his endowment policy. When the policy matures after 20 years, LIC pays a final, one-time terminal bonus of ₹50,000 on top of all the accumulated bonuses.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Book Reserve</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The amount of money an insurance company sets aside as a liability in its financial books to cover future claims.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> For every active policy, an insurer's accounting department maintains a book reserve, which is the calculated amount they need to have invested to fulfill their future promise to pay the claim.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Broker</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A licensed insurance professional who represents the client (the buyer) and can sell policies from multiple insurance companies.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of going directly to LIC, Fatima consults an insurance broker. The broker shows her and compares life insurance plans from LIC, HDFC Life, and ICICI Prudential, helping her choose the best fit.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Burial Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of final expense insurance with a small death benefit, specifically intended to cover funeral and burial costs.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An 80-year-old widow buys a ₹50,000 burial insurance policy so that her children won't have to worry about funeral expenses when she passes away.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Business Continuation Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>Insurance used to ensure a business can continue operating after the death or disability of a key owner or employee, often funding a buy-sell agreement.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A successful restaurant is famous because of its head chef. The restaurant owners buy a business continuation insurance policy on the chef's life to provide funds to hire a replacement and cover losses if the chef were to die unexpectedly.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Buy-Sell Agreement</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A legal contract that outlines how a deceased or departing partner's share of a business will be bought out by the remaining partners, often funded by life insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Two business partners, Sameer and Arjun, sign a buy-sell agreement. They each buy a life insurance policy on the other's life. If Sameer dies, the insurance payout gives Arjun the cash to buy Sameer's half of the business from his family.</p></div></div>

                <h2>C</h2>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Captive Agent</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An insurance agent who works exclusively for one insurance company and sells only their policies.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Mr. Sharma is a captive agent for LIC. This means he can only sell you LIC policies and cannot offer you a plan from Max Life or Bajaj Allianz.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cash Surrender Value</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The amount of money a policyholder receives if they voluntarily terminate a permanent life insurance policy before its maturity. It's the accumulated cash value minus any surrender charges.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After paying premiums for 10 years, Geeta's policy has an accumulated cash value of ₹1,50,000 and a surrender charge of ₹10,000. If she cancels the policy, her cash surrender value is ₹1,40,000.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cash Value Accumulation Test (CVAT)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>One of two IRS tests a policy must pass to qualify as life insurance for tax purposes. It limits the cash value relative to the death benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The insurer designs a universal life policy ensuring that the cash value never exceeds a certain percentage of the death benefit at any given age, thereby passing the CVAT and retaining its tax advantages.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Catastrophic Loss</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A severe loss that is very large and unexpected, such as from a natural disaster or pandemic, affecting many policyholders at once.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A major earthquake in a city would be a catastrophic loss for an insurance company, as they would face a huge number of simultaneous claims for life, health, and property damage.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Ceding Company</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The insurance company that transfers a portion of its risk to another insurer (the reinsurer) in a reinsurance agreement.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> ABC Insurance sells a massive ₹50 crore policy to a corporation.

This is concealment, and if he dies from a smoking-related illness, the insurer could refuse to pay the claim.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Conditional Receipt</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A receipt given when the first premium is paid with the application. It makes coverage effective from that date, provided the applicant is found to be insurable as a standard risk.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Anjali applies for a policy, pays the first premium, and gets a conditional receipt.

The insurer might automatically increase the death benefit to maintain the required corridor and its tax status.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cost Basis</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The total amount of premiums paid into a cash value policy. When a policy is surrendered, any amount received above the cost basis is typically taxable.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Over 20 years, John paid a total of ₹4 lakh in premiums for his policy. This ₹4 lakh is his cost basis. If he surrenders the policy for ₹5 lakh, he will have to pay tax on the ₹1 lakh gain.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cost of Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The charge deducted from a policy's cash value (especially in Universal Life) to cover the pure cost of the death benefit protection for that period. Also known as the mortality charge.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Each month, ₹50 is deducted from Sarah's Universal Life policy's cash value. This ₹50 is the Cost of Insurance for that month, covering the insurer's risk of her passing away.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Coverage</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The amount of risk or liability that is covered for an individual by insurance. Another term for Sum Assured or Death Benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A person says, "I have life insurance coverage of ₹1 crore," meaning their policy will pay out ₹1 crore upon their death.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Credit Life Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of life insurance designed to pay off a borrower's specific debt (like a car loan or mortgage) if they die before it is fully paid.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When buying a new car on loan, the bank offers Sameer a credit life insurance policy. If Sameer dies, the policy will pay the remaining car loan balance directly to the bank, so his family doesn't inherit the debt.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Critical Illness Rider</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An add-on that pays a lump-sum benefit if the insured is diagnosed with a specific serious illness listed in the policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Liam adds a critical illness rider to his life policy. When he is diagnosed with cancer, the rider pays him ₹10 lakh immediately, which he can use for treatment costs, independent of the main life insurance benefit.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cross Purchase Plan</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of buy-sell agreement where each business partner buys a life insurance policy on each of the other partners.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> In a three-partner firm (A, B, C), A buys policies on B and C, B buys policies on A and C, and C buys policies on A and B. This is a cross purchase plan to fund their buy-sell agreement.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Cumulative Premium</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The total amount of premiums paid on a policy from its inception to the current date.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If a policyholder has been paying an annual premium of ₹20,000 for 5 years, the cumulative premium paid is ₹1,00,000.</p></div></div>

The surrender value is ₹5 lakh. A life settlement company offers him ₹10 lakh in cash for the policy. The company now owns the policy, pays the premiums, and will collect the full ₹50 lakh when the man passes away.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Limited Benefit Policy</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An insurance policy that only covers specific, named perils or conditions, as opposed to a comprehensive policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A 'cancer care' policy is a limited benefit policy because it will only pay a claim if the insured is diagnosed with cancer, and not for any other illness like a heart attack or stroke.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Limited Payment Life</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of whole life insurance where premiums are paid for a limited number of years (e.g., 20 years or until age 65), but the coverage remains in force for the insured's entire life.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A person buys a "20-Pay" limited payment life policy. They pay premiums for only 20 years (from age 30 to 50). After age 50, they pay nothing more, but the life insurance coverage continues for the rest of their life.</p></div></div>

It does not have to be repaid, but any outstanding balance plus interest will be deducted from the death benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Needing funds for a home repair, Sumit takes a loan against his policy of ₹1 lakh. When he passes away a few years later with the loan still unpaid, his nominee receives the death benefit minus the ₹1 lakh loan and any accrued interest.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Loading</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The amount added to the net premium to cover the insurer's operating expenses, commissions, taxes, and a margin for profit and contingencies.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The pure cost (net premium) to cover claims for a policy is ₹800. The insurer adds a loading of ₹200 to cover agent commissions, office rent, and profit, making the final gross premium ₹1,000.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Long Duration Contract</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An insurance contract, such as life insurance, that is expected to remain in force for an extended period.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A whole life insurance policy is a long duration contract because it is designed to last for many decades, unlike a one-year car insurance policy.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Long-Term Care Rider</a><div class="term-definition"><p>An add-on that allows the policyholder to accelerate a portion of their death benefit to pay for long-term care services if they become chronically ill.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An elderly woman can no longer perform daily activities like eating and dressing by herself. She activates the long-term care rider on her life policy, which pays her a monthly benefit to cover the cost of a full-time nurse.</p></div></div>

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Medical Information Bureau (MIB)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A non-profit cooperative data exchange for North American insurance companies. It stores coded information from previous insurance applications to help prevent fraud and misrepresentation.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An applicant applies to Insurer A and declares a health condition. He then applies to Insurer B and hides it. Insurer B checks the MIB database and sees a code indicating the condition from the first application, which helps them uncover the fraud.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Medical Underwriting</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The process of an insurer evaluating an applicant's medical history, health status, and other health-related information to determine their risk profile and insurability.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The medical underwriting team reviewed the applicant's blood test results, doctor's reports, and family health history before approving his policy at a standard rate.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Misstatement of Age or Sex Clause</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A policy provision that states if the insured's age or sex was misstated on the application, the policy benefits will be adjusted to what the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age or sex.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A man stated his age as 40 when it was actually 45. At the time of a claim, the insurer discovers this. Instead of denying the claim, they use the misstatement of age clause to calculate and pay a lower death benefit—the amount the premium would have bought for a 45-year-old.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Mode of Premium / Premium Mode</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The frequency with which premiums are paid, such as annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Anita chooses the 'monthly' mode of premium for her policy, so her premium is automatically debited from her bank account each month. Her friend chose the 'yearly' mode and pays a single, larger premium once a year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Modified Endowment Contract (MEC)</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A life insurance policy that has been funded with more money than allowed under federal tax laws (failing the 7-pay test). MECs lose some of the tax advantages of regular life insurance; withdrawals and loans are potentially taxable and subject to penalties.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A policy requires a premium of ₹1 lakh per year. The policyholder decides to pay ₹10 lakh in the first year. This overfunding causes the policy to be classified as a Modified Endowment Contract, and any future withdrawals will be taxed differently.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Morale Hazard</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A risk attitude of indifference or carelessness towards loss because of the existence of insurance. For example, engaging in risky behavior because "insurance will cover it."</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A person with excellent health insurance might be less inclined to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen, thinking "if I get sick, my insurance will pay for it." This attitude is a morale hazard.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Morbidity Rate</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The frequency or incidence of a disease or illness within a population. It's a key factor in pricing health and disability insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To set the premium for a critical illness policy, an actuary studies the morbidity rate for cancer to predict how many policyholders out of 1,000 are likely to be diagnosed with the disease each year.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Mortality Charge</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The cost of the pure life insurance protection in a policy. In universal life, it is a monthly deduction from the cash value to cover the death benefit.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Out of a ₹5,000 monthly premium for a ULIP, ₹4,500 is invested, and ₹500 is deducted as the mortality charge to provide the life cover for that month.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Mortality Risk</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The risk that an individual will die sooner than expected, which is the primary risk an insurer assumes in a life insurance policy.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An insurance company faces mortality risk because if a large number of its policyholders die earlier than projected, the company will have to pay out more in claims than it collected in premiums.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Mortality Table</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A statistical chart that shows the death rate at each age, based on a large population, used by actuaries to calculate premiums and reserves.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An actuary uses a mortality table to determine the net premium for a 30-year-old applicant, noting the probability of death for each year of the policy term.</p></div></div>

Many policies have riders that provide benefits, such as waiver of premium or a lump-sum payment, for TPD.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> After an accident resulted in the loss of both arms, the insured was declared to have a Total and Permanent Disability, which triggered the TPD benefit in his insurance policy.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Trust</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A legal entity created to hold and manage assets on behalf of a beneficiary.

                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Universal Life Insurance</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A type of flexible permanent life insurance that combines a term insurance component with a tax-deferred savings element. Policyholders can adjust their premiums and death benefit as their needs change.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> John buys a universal life policy. In years when he has extra income, he pays a higher premium to build cash value faster. In lean years, he pays a lower premium, and the policy uses the existing cash value to cover its costs.</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Unpaid Premium</a><div class="term-definition"><p>A premium that is past its due date. If it is not paid by the end of the grace period, the policy will lapse.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A notice from the insurer states, "We are yet to receive your unpaid premium of ₹5,000 which was due on July 1st. Please pay before the grace period ends to avoid policy lapse."</p></div></div>
                <div class="term-entry"><a class="term-title">Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) Fees</a><div class="term-definition"><p>The standard amount that medical providers in a certain geographic area typically charge for a specific service. Insurers often use UCR to determine how much to reimburse for claims. More common in health insurance.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A hospital charges ₹1.5 lakh for a surgery, but the UCR fee for that surgery in that city is only ₹1.2 lakh.
