Combination 1: The Ultimate Child's Future Plan (Education & Marriage)
This combination is designed to provide funds for a child's key milestones, like higher education and marriage, while ensuring the plan continues even if the parent is no longer around.
Financial Goal: To create a guaranteed corpus for a child's future and ensure financial support for the family in case of the parent's untimely demise.
Plan Combination:
• Jeevan Lakshya (Plan 733): The core of the plan. It's an endowment plan with a unique death benefit.
• Jeevan Tarun (Plan 734): A specialized children's money-back plan to provide staggered funds during college years.
How It Works:
• Jeevan Lakshya acts as the main funding vehicle and safety net. If the parent passes away, future premiums are waived, the family receives an annual payout (10% of Sum Assured) until the maturity date, and the nominee still receives the full maturity amount at the end of the term.
• Jeevan Tarun is timed to provide money-back payments during the crucial college years (ages 20-24) to handle fees and other expenses.
Illustrative Example:
• Client: Mr. Kumar, age 30.
• Child: A 1-year-old daughter.
• Goal: Funds for her graduation (age 20-24) and a lump sum for her Master's/Marriage (age 25).

Scenario 1: Mr. Kumar Survives the Term
• During College (Child's age 20-24): From the Jeevan Tarun policy, the family receives ₹1,50,000 (15% of ₹10 Lakh SA) every year for 5 years.
• At Maturity (Child's age 25):
• From Jeevan Lakshya: Approx. ₹41,60,000 (₹20L SA + Vested Bonus + FAB).
• From Jeevan Tarun: Approx. ₹5,00,000 (25% of ₹10L SA + Vested Bonus + FAB).
• Total Maturity Corpus at Age 25: **~ ₹46.6 Lakhs**
Scenario 2: Mr. Kumar passes away after 5 years
• Immediate Benefit: The family receives the death benefit from both plans.
• Jeevan Lakshya's Magic:
• All future premiums are waived.
• The family starts receiving ₹2,00,000 every year (10% of SA) until the policy matures.
• At the original maturity date (when the child turns 25), the nominee receives the full maturity amount of **~ ₹41.6 Lakhs**.
• Jeevan Tarun: The death benefit is paid out, providing immediate liquidity.
Key Advantage: This combination provides unparalleled security. The child's future is financially secured no matter what.

Combination 2: The Ultimate Tax-Free Pension & Legacy Plan
This combination is for professionals who want to create a guaranteed, tax-free income stream for life post-retirement, and leave a massive legacy for their family.
Financial Goal: To create a lifelong pension that isn't dependent on the stock market, supplement it with a large initial retirement corpus, and create generational wealth.
Plan Combination:
• Jeevan Umang (Plan 745): The pension engine. It provides a guaranteed 8% of the Sum Assured annually after the premium paying term, for life (up to age 100).
• Jeevan Labh (Plan 736): The retirement booster. A limited premium endowment plan timed to mature exactly when the pension from Jeevan Umang begins.
How It Works:
• You pay premiums for both plans during your working years.
• The Jeevan Labh policy matures at your retirement age (e.g., 60), giving you a large, tax-free lump sum to fulfill immediate goals like travel, buying property, or clearing loans.
• In the same year, your premium payments for Jeevan Umang stop, and you start receiving a guaranteed, tax-free "pension" for the rest of your life.
Illustrative Example:
• Client: Ms. Gupta, age 40.
• Goal: Retire at 60 with a large corpus and a lifelong income.
Plan DetailsJeevan Umang (745)Jeevan Labh (736)Client's Age4040Policy Term60 Years (100 - 40)20 Years (Matures at age 60)Premium Paying Term20 Years (Stops at age 60)15 YearsBasic Sum Assured₹25,00,000₹20,00,000
Scenario: Ms. Gupta at age 60
• Lump Sum Boost: The Jeevan Labh policy matures. She receives approximately ₹42,00,000 (₹20L SA + Vested Bonus + FAB) as a tax-free amount.
• Pension Starts: The Jeevan Umang policy starts paying her ₹2,00,000 every year (8% of ₹25L SA). This income is tax-free and guaranteed for life.
• Legacy: When Ms. Gupta passes away (at any age after 60), her nominee will receive a massive death benefit from the Jeevan Umang policy, which could be well over ₹1 Crore (SA + accumulated bonuses).
Key Advantage: This combination creates a perfect retirement solution: a large lump sum for immediate needs and a worry-free, guaranteed income stream for life, all while creating a huge tax-free estate for her children.

Combination 3: The "Crorepati" Plan (Maximum Protection + High Savings)
This combination is ideal for young earners who want maximum life cover for their family at a low cost, while aggressively saving for long-term wealth creation.
Financial Goal: To have a high-value life insurance cover (of ₹1 Crore or more) from day one, and simultaneously build a substantial maturity corpus.
Plan Combination:
• New Jeevan Amar (Plan 955): A pure term insurance plan. This is the protection foundation.
• Jeevan Labh (Plan 736): A high-bonus-earning endowment plan. This is the savings engine.
How It Works:
• This strategy "buys term and invests the difference."
• A small portion of the budget goes to the New Jeevan Amar plan to secure a very large Sum Assured (e.g., ₹1 Crore). This ensures the family is financially protected against any eventuality.
• The rest of the savings budget is channeled into Jeevan Labh, which has a limited premium paying term and offers excellent returns in the form of bonuses, to build the wealth corpus.
Illustrative Example:
• Client: Mr. Singh, age 25.
• Goal: Secure his family with a ₹1 Crore cover and build wealth for his future.
Plan DetailsNew Jeevan Amar (955)Jeevan Labh (736)Client's Age2525Policy Term35 Years (Cover till age 60)25 Years (Matures at age 50)Premium Paying Term35 Years (Regular Pay)16 YearsBasic Sum Assured₹1,00,00,000₹25,00,000
Scenario 1: Mr. Singh Survives the Term
• At Age 50: His Jeevan Labh policy matures. He receives a huge tax-free corpus of approximately ₹66,00,000 (₹25L SA + Vested Bonus + FAB). He can use this for his child's higher education, buying a house, or early retirement planning.
• His New Jeevan Amar policy continues to provide the ₹1 Crore risk cover until he turns 60.
Scenario 2: Mr. Singh passes away during the policy term (e.g., at age 40)
• Immediate Financial Support: His nominee receives:
• ₹1,00,00,000 tax-free from the New Jeevan Amar policy.
• The death benefit from the Jeevan Labh policy, which would be approx. ₹40,00,000+ (SA + accrued bonuses).
• Total Payout to Family: **~ ₹1.4 Crore**, ensuring complete financial stability for his family.
Key Advantage: This is the most efficient way to achieve high protection and high savings. It provides peace of mind with a massive life cover at a low cost, without compromising on building a significant corpus for life goals.
Disclaimer: The maturity amounts are illustrative and based on current bonus rates, which are not guaranteed and may vary. For exact premiums and benefits, please use official LIC calculators or consult an authorized agent.

Excellent request. Moving beyond the most common combinations allows us to explore the versatility of LIC's product suite to craft highly specialized solutions. Here are three more distinct plan combinations using different policies from your list, each designed for a unique financial objective.

Combination 4: The HNI's Legacy & Liquidity Powerhouse
This is a premium combination designed for High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs) who want guaranteed periodic cash flows for lifestyle or business needs, coupled with a massive legacy creation for the next generation.
Financial Goal: To generate large, tax-free cash infusions at regular intervals and simultaneously establish a multi-crore estate.
Plan Combination:
• Bima Shree (Plan 748): The HNI money-back engine. It provides guaranteed additions and significant survival benefits.
• New Jeevan Amar (Plan 955): The low-cost legacy multiplier. A term plan to create a very large death benefit.
How It Works:
• Bima Shree is the core savings and liquidity vehicle. Its high minimum Sum Assured (₹10 Lakh) and guaranteed additions make it ideal for HNIs. The survival benefits are paid out as large, tax-free lump sums.
• New Jeevan Amar is used purely for protection. A very high Sum Assured is taken for a relatively low premium, ensuring that no matter what, a substantial legacy is left behind.
Illustrative Example:
• Client: Mr. Sharma, a 40-year-old successful entrepreneur.
• Goal: Receive large payouts at age 56 and 58, and leave a legacy of over ₹3 Crores.
Plan DetailsBima Shree (748)New Jeevan Amar (955)Client's Age4040Policy Term20 Years (Matures at age 60)30 Years (Cover till age 70)Premium Paying Term16 Years30 Years (Regular Pay)Basic Sum Assured₹50,00,000₹2,50,00,000 (₹2.5 Crore)
Scenario 1: Mr. Sharma Survives
• At Age 56 (16th Policy Year): He receives a Survival Benefit from Bima Shree of ₹22,50,000 (45% of ₹50L SA), tax-free.
• At Age 58 (18th Policy Year): He receives another Survival Benefit from Bima Shree of ₹22,50,000 (45% of ₹50L SA), tax-free.
• At Age 60 (Maturity): The Bima Shree policy matures. He receives the remaining 10% of SA + Guaranteed Additions + Loyalty Addition. This could be approximately ₹45,00,000.
• His ₹2.5 Crore life cover from Jeevan Amar continues until he is 70.
Scenario 2: Mr. Sharma passes away at age 50
• Immediate Payout to Nominee:
• From New Jeevan Amar: ₹2,50,00,000 (₹2.5 Crore).
• From Bima Shree: The death benefit, which is 125% of Basic SA + accrued Guaranteed Additions. This would be approx. ₹62.5 Lakhs + GAs, easily totaling over ₹90 Lakhs.
• Total Legacy Left for Family: **~ ₹3.4 Crores**, providing immense financial security.
Key Advantage: This combination provides the "best of both worlds" for an HNI: substantial tax-free liquidity during their lifetime and a massive estate for their heirs, all through guaranteed and secure instruments.

Combination 5: The "Guaranteed Milestones" Ladder
This combination is perfect for the meticulous planner who wants absolute certainty. It uses plans with guaranteed additions to create a "ladder" of payouts, timed perfectly to fund specific, non-negotiable life goals.
Financial Goal: To get a guaranteed, pre-defined amount of money at different future dates (e.g., for a house down payment, a child's college admission, and a pre-retirement corpus).
Plan Combination:
• Bima Jyoti (Plan 760) - Policy 1: The first rung of the ladder.
• Bima Jyoti (Plan 760) - Policy 2: The second rung of the ladder.
How It Works:
• The magic is in buying two policies of the same plan (Bima Jyoti) at the same time but with different policy terms.
• Bima Jyoti offers a guaranteed addition of ₹50 per ₹1000 Sum Assured every year, making the maturity amount highly predictable and not dependent on variable bonuses.
• By choosing different terms, you create staggered maturities, delivering guaranteed lump sums exactly when you need them.
Illustrative Example:
• Client: Ms. Desai, age 30.
• Goals:
• A corpus of ~₹10 Lakhs at age 45 for her child's high school coaching.
• A larger corpus of ~₹20 Lakhs at age 50 for college fees.
Plan DetailsBima Jyoti (Policy 1)Bima Jyoti (Policy 2)Client's Age3030Policy Term15 Years20 YearsPremium Paying Term10 Years15 YearsBasic Sum Assured₹6,00,000₹10,00,000
Scenario: Ms. Desai Survives
• Premiums: For the first 10 years, she pays premiums for both policies. From year 11 to 15, she only pays the premium for Policy 2. After 15 years, all premium payments stop.
• Payout 1 (At Age 45): Policy 1 matures. She receives:
• Basic Sum Assured: ₹6,00,000
• Guaranteed Additions: (₹50 x 600 x 15 years) = ₹4,50,000
• Total Guaranteed Payout: ₹10,50,000
• Payout 2 (At Age 50): Policy 2 matures. She receives:
• Basic Sum Assured: ₹10,00,000
• Guaranteed Additions: (₹50 x 1000 x 20 years) = ₹10,00,000
• Total Guaranteed Payout: ₹20,00,000
Key Advantage: Unmatched predictability. This combination removes all guesswork associated with bonuses. The client knows the exact guaranteed amount they will receive on specific dates, making it perfect for crucial, non-negotiable financial goals.
Combination 6: The Young Professional's "Growth & Gratification" Plan
This is designed for young earners in their 20s. It balances the need for long-term wealth creation with the desire for periodic gratification (funds for travel, gadgets, or upskilling) in the short term.
Financial Goal: To enjoy life's smaller luxuries along the way without derailing the primary goal of building a substantial corpus by middle age.
Plan Combination:
• 25 Year Money Back (Plan 721): The "Gratification" plan, providing regular cash flows.
• New Endowment (Plan 714): The "Growth" plan, a simple and steady wealth builder running in the background.
How It Works:
• The Money Back Plan (721) acts as a disciplined savings tool that pays back portions of the Sum Assured at regular 5-year intervals, giving the policyholder funds for short-term goals.
• The classic New Endowment Plan (714) is taken for a longer term. It has a lower premium and works silently to compound a large maturity amount for a major long-term goal, like buying a home or planning for financial independence.
Illustrative Example:
• Client: Mr. Rao, age 25, just started his career.
• Goal: Get regular payouts in his 30s and 40s, and build a large corpus by age 55.
Plan Details25 Year Money Back (721)New Endowment (714)Client's Age2525Policy Term25 Years (Matures at age 50)30 Years (Matures at age 55)Premium Paying Term20 Years30 YearsBasic Sum Assured₹10,00,000₹20,00,000
Scenario: Mr. Rao survives
• At Age 30 (5th year): Receives ₹1,50,000 from the Money Back plan.
• At Age 35 (10th year): Receives ₹1,50,000 from the Money Back plan.
• At Age 40 (15th year): Receives ₹1,50,000 from the Money Back plan.
• At Age 45 (20th year): Receives ₹1,50,000 from the Money Back plan.
• At Age 50 (Maturity 1): The Money Back plan matures. He gets the remaining 40% of SA + Bonuses. Approx. ₹4,00,000 + Bonus, totaling around ₹11,00,000.
• At Age 55 (Maturity 2): The New Endowment plan matures. He gets the full SA + Bonuses. Approx. ₹20,00,000 + Bonus, totaling around ₹58,00,000.
Key Advantage: This combination perfectly aligns with a young professional's psychology. It provides disciplined savings with the motivation of regular, short-term rewards, while the long-term endowment plan ensures a robust financial foundation is built for the future.

This is an excellent and highly specific request. It requires a precise combination of three different types of plans working in perfect harmony to create a multi-stage cash flow structure. I can absolutely build this for you using only the plans from the total plans.txt file you provided.
Here is the three-part combination plan designed to meet your exact requirements.

The "Triple-Action" Income & Corpus Combination
This solution is built with three distinct policies, purchased at the same time, each performing a unique role to deliver your desired outcome.
The Plan Combination:
• Immediate Pension: Jeevan Akshay VII (Plan 857)
• Periodic Survival Benefits: 25 Year Money Back (Plan 721)
• Single Premium Lump Sum: Single Premium Endowment (Plan 717)
Here is a summary of how we'll structure it:
ComponentPlan NameRole in CombinationPolicy TermPremium PaymentPolicy 1Jeevan Akshay VII (857)Provides immediate, guaranteed pension for 20 years.For Life (with 20-Year Guarantee)Single Premium (One-time)Policy 225 Year Money Back (721)Provides survival benefits every 5 years and a final maturity payout.25 YearsLimited Premium (Pay for 20 years)Policy 3Single Premium Endowment (717)Builds a large, single lump sum corpus.25 YearsSingle Premium (One-time)
How It Works & Illustrative Example
Let's assume the client is Mr. Roy, age 40, and he wants to implement this strategy.
Step 1: The Immediate Pension Engine (Policy 1)
• Plan: Jeevan Akshay VII (Plan 857)
• Action: Mr. Roy makes a one-time, single premium payment. Let's say ₹20,00,000.
• Crucial Choice: He selects "Option (ii): Annuity guaranteed for 20 years and for life thereafter."
• Result: Starting from the very next month/quarter/year (depending on mode chosen), LIC starts paying him a pension. This pension is guaranteed to be paid for 20 years, whether he survives or not (if he passes away, the nominee gets it). If he lives beyond 20 years, the pension continues for his entire life.
• Illustrative Pension: A ₹20 Lakh single premium could generate approximately ₹1,20,000 per year for life, guaranteed for the first 20 years.
Step 2: The Periodic Liquidity Provider (Policy 2)
• Plan: 25 Year Money Back (Plan 721)
• Action: At the same time, Mr. Roy buys this policy for a Sum Assured of ₹20,00,000. He will pay regular premiums for this for 20 years.
• Result: While the pension from Policy 1 provides a steady income, this plan provides larger, periodic cash infusions for bigger expenses or investment opportunities. It also builds towards a significant maturity value.
Step 3: The Silent Wealth Builder (Policy 3)
• Plan: Single Premium Endowment (Plan 717)
• Action: Also at the same time, Mr. Roy makes a second one-time, single premium payment into this plan. Let's say ₹10,00,000. He chooses a policy term of 25 years.
• Result: This policy requires no further attention. It will sit quietly and grow through the accumulation of bonuses for 25 years, designed to mature at the exact same time as Policy 2.
Timeline of Your Cash Flows
Here is a clear timeline of what Mr. Roy will receive:
Phase 1: The Pension & Liquidity Phase (Years 1 to 20)
• Every Year: He receives ~₹1,20,000 as a guaranteed pension from Policy 1 (Jeevan Akshay).
• At Year 5 (Age 45): He receives ₹3,00,000 (15% of ₹20L SA) from Policy 2 (Money Back).
• At Year 10 (Age 50): He receives ₹3,00,000 (15% of ₹20L SA) from Policy 2 (Money Back).
• At Year 15 (Age 55): He receives ₹3,00,000 (15% of ₹20L SA) from Policy 2 (Money Back).
• At Year 20 (Age 60): He receives ₹3,00,000 (15% of ₹20L SA) from Policy 2 (Money Back).
• His pension guarantee period from Policy 1 ends, but the payments will continue as long as he lives.
• His premium payments for Policy 2 also stop.
Phase 2: The Grand Maturity Finale (Year 25 / Age 65)
This is the year when the two long-term plans mature together, delivering a massive lump sum.
• Maturity of Policy 2 (Money Back):
• He receives the remaining 40% of the Sum Assured (₹8,00,000) plus all the accumulated bonuses.
• Estimated Payout: ~ ₹20,00,000
• Maturity of Policy 3 (Single Premium Endowment):
• He receives the full Sum Assured plus all the accumulated bonuses from his one-time investment.
• Estimated Payout: ~ ₹35,00,000
• Total Lump Sum Received at Age 65: Approximately ₹55,00,000!
Key Advantages of this Combination:
• Immediate Cash Flow: The pension starts right away, providing instant returns on your investment.
• Layered Liquidity: You get a steady annual income from the pension, layered with large, tax-free lump sums every 5 years for major goals.
• Disciplined Long-Term Growth: You make a one-time investment in the Single Premium plan and let it grow undisturbed for the long term.
• Synchronized Maturity: Both of your major savings plans are timed to mature together, creating a huge, planned corpus for your post-retirement needs.
This combination brilliantly utilizes three different plan structures to achieve a very sophisticated and powerful financial outcome.

This is an outstanding and very thoughtful financial planning goal. You are looking to create a comprehensive, multi-stage financial support system for your daughter that covers all key life milestones. This is precisely what expert plan combinations are designed for.
Using the plans from the list you provided, I have designed a "Triple-Shield" combination that perfectly maps to your requirements.

The "Daughter's Lifelong Financial Security" Plan
This is a powerful three-policy combination designed to provide:
• Education Fund: Staggered annual payouts during her college years.
• Marriage Corpus: A large, tax-free lump sum for her wedding or to help her start her own life.
• Lifelong Pension: A guaranteed, tax-free income for her later years, ensuring her financial independence.
The Plan Combination:

How It Works & Illustrative Example
Let's assume the client is Mr. Gupta, age 30, and his daughter, Anjali, is 1 year old.
Step 1: The Education Fund (Policy 1)
• Plan: Jeevan Tarun (Plan 734)
• Life Assured: Anjali (age 1) | Proposer: Mr. Gupta
• Action: He buys this policy with a Sum Assured of ₹15,00,000. The policy will mature when Anjali turns 25. He will pay premiums until she is 20.
• Crucial Choice: He selects Option 4, which gives the highest money-back payout: 15% of the Sum Assured for 5 years.
• Result (College Years):
• When Anjali turns 20, she receives ₹2,25,000 (15% of ₹15L).
• At age 21, she receives ₹2,25,000.
• At age 22, she receives ₹2,25,000.
• At age 23, she receives ₹2,25,000.
• At age 24, she receives ₹2,25,000.
This provides a steady stream of funds for her higher education.
Step 2: The Marriage Corpus & Safety Net (Policy 2)
• Plan: Jeevan Lakshya (Plan 733)
• Life Assured: Mr. Gupta (age 30) | Nominee: Anjali
• Action: He buys this policy for a Sum Assured of ₹25,00,000. He chooses a policy term of 24 years, so it matures when he is 54 and Anjali is 25. He will pay premiums for 21 years.
• Result (Marriage Corpus):
• When Anjali turns 25, the policy matures. The family receives a massive, tax-free lump sum.
• Estimated Payout: Approximately ₹53,00,000 (₹25L SA + Vested Bonus + FAB). This provides a substantial corpus for her marriage or to help her settle down.
• (This plan has a crucial death benefit, which is explained in the "Ultimate Safety Net" section below.)
Step 3: The Lifelong Pension (Policy 3)
• Plan: Jeevan Umang (Plan 745)
• Life Assured: Anjali (age 1) | Proposer: Mr. Gupta
• Action: He buys this policy with a Sum Assured of ₹10,00,000. He chooses a Premium Paying Term (PPT) of 30 years. This means he will pay premiums until he is 60, and Anjali is 31.
• Result (Pension for Later Years):
• The year Anjali turns 31, the premium payments stop, and the plan's survival benefits begin.
• She starts receiving ₹80,000 every year (8% of ₹10L SA).
• This income is guaranteed for her entire life (until she is 100) and is tax-free. It provides a foundational income, ensuring she always has financial dignity and independence.
The Ultimate Safety Net: The Power of Jeevan Lakshya
This is the most important part of the combination. What happens if Mr. Gupta passes away prematurely (e.g., at age 40)?
• Immediate Payout: The family receives an immediate death benefit from Jeevan Lakshya (110% of the Sum Assured), which is ₹27,50,000.
• Premium Waiver: ALL future premiums for the Jeevan Lakshya policy are waived. The policy continues as if the premiums were being paid.
• Annual Support: The family starts receiving ₹2,50,000 every year (10% of SA) until the original maturity date. This takes care of the family's immediate needs and Anjali's upbringing.
• Maturity Benefit is Still Paid: On the original maturity date (when Anjali turns 25), she STILL receives the full maturity value of approximately ₹53,00,000, just as planned.
The death benefits from the other two plans (where Anjali is the Life Assured) would also be payable, ensuring all of Anjali's future needs are more than taken care of.
Key Advantages of this Combination:
• Goal-Specific Funding: Each policy is chosen for its specific strength in funding a particular life goal.
• Automatic & Disciplined: The plan forces a disciplined savings habit to ensure all goals are met.
• Bulletproof Security: The inclusion of Jeevan Lakshya ensures that the daughter's future is completely secured, no matter what happens to the parent. The plan is self-completing.
• Lifelong Independence: By setting up a pension plan for her, you are giving her the gift of lifelong financial independence, a true legacy of parental care.
